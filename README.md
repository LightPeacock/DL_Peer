Features

- 3D Model Generation: The code can generate 3D models based on a textual prompt.
- User Interface: The project also includes a UI for easy interaction with the model generation functionality.

Requirements

Before running the code, please ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- A virtual environment (venv) for managing dependencies.

Setup Instructions
1. Create a Folder for the Project
Create a folder where you'll store the code files.

2. Save the Python Script
Place the provided `.py` file into the folder you just created.

3. Set the Directory in the Code
In the `.py` file, locate the section of the code where the directory path is specified. Replace the placeholder with the full path of the folder where the script is stored.

4. Create a Virtual Environment (venv)
In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder and create a virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv


5. Install Dependencies

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  
- On macOS/Linux:
  bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  

Install the required dependencies using `pip`

6. Run the Code

Once all dependencies are installed, run the Python script from within the virtual environment:

bash
python your_script_name.py

7. Interact with the UI

Follow the on-screen instructions in the UI to generate 3D models based on your prompts.
